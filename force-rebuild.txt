# Steps to force a fresh build and clear caches:

1. Clear your browser cache:
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Or open Developer Tools > Network tab > check "Disable cache"

2. If still seeing the error, force a Vercel rebuild:
   - Option A: Push an empty commit
     git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Vercel rebuild"
     git push origin main
   
   - Option B: Go to Vercel dashboard
     - Find your deployment
     - Click "Redeploy" > "Redeploy with existing Build Cache" (unchecked)

3. Wait for the new deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

4. Test again with a cleared browser cache

The Clock import fix is already in your code, so this should resolve the runtime error.
