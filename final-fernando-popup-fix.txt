# Git commands to ensure Fernando-X uses popup chat everywhere

cd "/Users/fernandox/Desktop/Houston Land Group New Webiste/houston-development-intelligence"

git add app/page.tsx

git commit -m "Ensure Fernando-X always opens as popup chat

- Updated Fernando-X module card to trigger popup instead of navigation
- Changed CTA button to open chat popup
- Fixed all links to /assistant to open popup chat instead

Now Fernando-X consistently appears as:
- Floating purple button in bottom-right
- Opens as popup chat overlay
- Never navigates to full-page interface
