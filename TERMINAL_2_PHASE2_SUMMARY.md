# Terminal 2: Phase 2 Completion Summary

## Overview
Terminal 2 has successfully completed Phase 2 of the Houston Development Intelligence project, focusing on API integration and the Market Intelligence Dashboard.

## Completed Features

### 1. ✅ API Integration with Terminal 3
- Created custom React hooks using SWR for data fetching
- Implemented API client with axios and error handling
- Added authentication and response interceptors
- Hooks created:
  - `useMarketData()` - Real-time market metrics
  - `useNeighborhoodComparison()` - Compare multiple neighborhoods
  - `usePropertyAnalysis()` - Property-specific data
  - `useROICalculation()` - Server-side ROI calculations
  - `useLeadCapture()` - Lead management
  - `useSaveCalculation()` - Save user calculations
  - `useMarketTiming()` - Market timing indicators
  - `useCalculationHistory()` - User calculation history

### 2. ✅ Enhanced ROI Calculator (V2)
- Integrated with Terminal 3's backend APIs
- Server-side validation via POST `/api/tools/roi-calculator`
- Lead capture through POST `/api/leads`
- Added features:
  - Save calculations to database
  - PDF report download functionality
  - Remember previous calculations
  - Real-time property data fetching
  - Analytics tracking for A/B testing

### 3. ✅ Market Intelligence Dashboard
Built comprehensive dashboard with:
- **Real-time Metrics**: Price per sq ft, days on market, active listings, market score
- **Interactive Charts** (using Recharts):
  - Price history area chart
  - Neighborhood comparison bar chart
  - Property type distribution pie chart
  - Demand score radar chart
- **Market Timing Indicators**: Buy/Sell/Hold scores with visual indicators
- **Neighborhood Comparison**: Select up to 5 neighborhoods for side-by-side analysis
- **Time Range Selector**: 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y views
- **Lead Capture Modal**: Captures leads for detailed reports
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layout

### 4. ✅ UI/UX Enhancements
- Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Lead capture modal with validation
- Success notifications for saved calculations
- Interactive neighborhood selection chips
- Gradient backgrounds and modern styling

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `recharts` - Data visualization
- `react-pdf` & `@react-pdf/renderer` - PDF generation
- `axios` - HTTP client
- `swr` - Data fetching and caching
- `react-hot-toast` - Notifications (optional)

## API Endpoints Integrated
All calls go through Terminal 3's proxy:
- `/api/tools/roi-calculator` - ROI calculations
- `/api/leads` - Lead capture
- `/api/core-agents/market-intelligence` - Market data
- `/api/core-agents/neighborhood-comparison` - Comparison data
- `/api/core-agents/property-analysis` - Property details
- `/api/core-agents/market-timing` - Timing indicators
- `/api/calculations/save` - Save calculations
- `/api/reports/pdf/{id}` - PDF generation
- `/api/analytics/track` - Event tracking

## Performance Optimizations
- Client-side caching with SWR
- Debounced API calls
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies
- Fast (<1s) client-side calculations

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Implement React.memo for expensive chart components
- Add more advanced filtering options
- Integrate with more Core Agents endpoints
- Add historical trend analysis
- Implement user authentication for saved calculations

## Usage
1. ROI Calculator V2: Visit `/roi-calculator`
2. Market Intelligence: Visit `/intelligence`
3. Both tools integrate seamlessly with Terminal 3's backend
4. Lead capture is required for detailed reports
5. All interactions are tracked for analytics

Terminal 2 Phase 2 is complete and ready for production!
