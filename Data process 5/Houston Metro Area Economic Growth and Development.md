Houston Metro Area Key Economic Performance Indicators for 2025

## Economic Performance Overview

### GDP Growth and Regional Economic Output

Houston's economic expansion has been particularly strong since the COVID-19 pandemic recovery began in 2021. From 2021 to 2023, Houston's GDP grew by 25.1 percent, significantly faster than the U.S. overall growth of 16.0 percent during the same period[^1]. Among the 20 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas, Houston has demonstrated the fastest-growing economy since 2021 as measured by GDP[^1].

The region's Gross Domestic Product reached a record high of \$697.0 billion in 2023, representing a 7.9 percent increase from \$645.8 billion in 2022[^1]. This substantial growth trajectory positions Houston as a major economic powerhouse, with projections indicating continued expansion throughout 2025 despite broader national economic uncertainties[^2].

Houston's economic performance has been particularly impressive when compared to other major metropolitan areas. The city has grown more than twice as quickly as San Francisco and at nearly double the pace of the largest metro areas including New York and Los Angeles[^1]. This accelerated growth reflects the region's competitive advantages in key industries and its ability to attract both domestic and international investment.

### Economic Output by Sector

Houston's economy demonstrates remarkable diversification across multiple high-value sectors. Five industries serve as the primary drivers of economic growth: manufacturing, professional/business services, real estate, government, and healthcare/education, which together comprise more than 50 percent of Houston's GDP in 2023[^1].

![Houston Metro Area GDP by Economic Sector (2025) - Total GDP: \$697 billion](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/b5dcb35aef8006d38bfb6162f4d3f910/79a3c13d-ab26-45d9-9dc8-42e368681eba/15bc6c2d.png)

Houston Metro Area GDP by Economic Sector (2025) - Total GDP: \$697 billion

Manufacturing remains a cornerstone of Houston's economy, contributing approximately 11.3 percent to the region's GDP and generating \$75 billion annually while employing over 239,600 people[^3]. The Houston region hosts roughly 6,500 manufacturers that produce more than \$80 billion in products annually, with continued growth momentum[^4]. Professional and business services represent 16.3 percent of total employment in the Houston area, reflecting the region's role as a major corporate and consulting hub[^5].

The energy sector, including oil and gas extraction and support activities, continues to play a vital role despite global market volatilities. Mining and logging employment grew 4.2 percent year-over-year through January 2025, representing one of the fastest-growing sectors in percentage terms across the Houston area[^5]. Trade, transportation, and utilities sector remains the largest employer, accounting for 20.4 percent of total employment and benefiting significantly from Houston's position as the nation's largest port by tonnage[^6].

### Population and Employment Growth

Houston's demographic expansion continues at an unprecedented pace, with the metro area adding nearly 200,000 residents in 2024, bringing the total population to 7.8 million people[^7]. This represents the largest annual increase on record, equivalent to a new resident every 2.7 minutes[^7]. The region maintained the second-highest population growth rate among major metros at 2.5 percent, significantly outpacing the national average[^7].

Employment growth has accompanied this population surge, with Houston adding approximately 29,600 jobs between May 2024 and May 2025, reaching total non-farm payroll employment of 3,471,300 jobs[^8]. The city created 57,800 jobs in 2024, finishing the year with payroll employment at 3.5 million, a record for the region[^9]. However, employment growth has moderated in the first half of 2025, with the region experiencing some volatility due to seasonal adjustments and sector-specific challenges[^6].

The unemployment rate has remained relatively stable at 4.5 percent as of May 2025, slightly above the Texas state average of 4.1 percent but indicative of a healthy labor market with continued job creation opportunities[^10]. Houston's labor force has grown to support the expanding population, though growth rates have moderated compared to the post-pandemic boom period[^11].

## Business Formation and Development Activity

### New Business Formation Statistics

Texas achieved a significant milestone in business formation, starting 2025 with 2,928,688 registered business entities, representing an increase of 125,329 entities from the previous year[^12]. This growth reflects the state's continued attraction for entrepreneurs and out-of-state entities seeking to expand operations in Texas[^12]. The business formation rate has nearly doubled over the past decade, growing from 1.47 million entities in 2015 to 2.93 million entities by 2025[^12].

Houston specifically has contributed significantly to this business formation surge. The Greater Houston Partnership identified 142 new business announcements in the Houston area during Q1 2025, representing a 2.2 percent increase over Q1 2024[^13]. These announcements encompass companies planning to establish, relocate, or expand existing operations in the region[^13].

![Houston Metro Area Business Formation and Investment Activity - Q1 2025](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/b5dcb35aef8006d38bfb6162f4d3f910/180f8710-85fe-4106-9c2b-6b9c8e9ac06d/a22eb116.png)

Houston Metro Area Business Formation and Investment Activity - Q1 2025

The Q1 2025 business announcements created substantial economic impact, generating 3,429 jobs, \$2.7 billion in capital investment, and 15.4 million square feet of occupied space[^13]. Notably, the amount of jobs created, capital investment, and square footage nearly doubled compared to Q1 2024, indicating accelerating business development momentum[^13].

### Corporate Relocations and Headquarters Movements

Houston has emerged as a major destination for corporate headquarters relocations, ranking fourth nationally for such moves between 2018 and 2024. During this period, Houston attracted 31 corporate headquarters, tying with Phoenix for the fourth-highest total among U.S. metropolitan areas[^14]. This achievement places Houston behind Dallas (100), Austin (81), and Nashville (35) in the corporate relocation rankings[^14].

High-profile companies that relocated their headquarters to the Houston area include Chevron, ExxonMobil, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Murphy Oil[^14]. These relocations have been driven by access to lower taxes, availability of tax incentives, proximity to key markets, and the ability to support hybrid work arrangements[^14]. The energy sector has been particularly active in these relocations, with Houston's position as the global energy capital continuing to attract major energy corporations[^14].

The 2024 year marked a significant acceleration in corporate headquarters movements, with 96 announcements nationwide compared to just 18 the previous year. Texas accounted for over 25 percent of these moves, cementing its leadership position[^15]. Recent notable moves include companies like Schneider Electric expanding operations and various manufacturing firms establishing new facilities in the Houston area[^13].

### Foreign Direct Investment and International Business

Houston's role as a global business hub has been reinforced through substantial foreign direct investment activities. The region hosted the Texas Port to the Stars Foreign Direct Investment Summit in April 2025, attracting over 140 leaders from business, government, and global trade networks, including representatives from more than 12 foreign countries[^16][^17]. Countries represented included Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Singapore, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam[^16].

The Houston/Galveston Customs District led the U.S. in exports, shipping \$180.9 billion in goods in 2024, more than any other metro area[^18]. The region set records by handling 432.6 million metric tons of goods valued at \$376.3 billion through the Houston/Galveston Customs District in 2024[^18]. This international trade activity positions Houston as a critical gateway for global commerce and foreign investment.

Houston's international connectivity includes nearly 1,000 foreign-owned firms and over 1.8 million residents born outside the U.S., creating a multicultural environment that supports foreign direct investment[^19]. The city's status as a global trade leader is reflected in its routine ranking as the top U.S. metro for exports[^19].

## Major Development Projects and Infrastructure

### Transportation and Infrastructure Projects

Houston is undergoing transformative infrastructure development through multiple major projects. The city announced plans for what officials call the "largest development project in 50 years" - a comprehensive entertainment and convention district connecting Downtown Houston with the East End[^20]. This massive development, funded entirely by Hotel Occupancy Tax revenue, will feature a 700,000-square-foot expansion of the George R. Brown Convention Center, including the largest ballroom in Texas[^20].

The project includes a new 100,000-square-foot pedestrian plaza connecting to the Toyota Center and expansion of Avenida Plaza to Discovery Green[^20]. The GRB Houston South expansion is scheduled for completion by May 2028, with the full campus reaching completion by 2038[^20]. This development represents a significant investment in Houston's tourism and convention infrastructure.

Port Houston continues substantial infrastructure investments to support growing cargo volumes. The port moved 356,407 twenty-foot equivalent units in January 2025, marking a 7 percent increase and the busiest January on record[^21]. Container volumes reached 381,640 TEUs in May 2025, representing a 5 percent year-over-year increase, with year-to-date volumes reaching 1,837,813 TEUs[^22].

### Real Estate and Commercial Development

Houston's commercial real estate market has demonstrated resilience with positive absorption and continued development activity. The industrial market recorded 791,664 square feet of positive net absorption in Q1 2025, reflecting steady tenant demand[^21]. The construction pipeline remains active with 11 million square feet currently under development at 9.8 percent pre-leased[^21].

Multiple major mixed-use developments are transforming Houston neighborhoods. GreenStreet, the four-block downtown district, is undergoing a multimillion-dollar renovation converting the former Forever 21 building into a pedestrian-friendly alleyway with dining, retail, and nightlife attractions[^23]. The Swift Building in the Heights neighborhood is being transformed from a 1909 cottonseed oil refinery into a modern restaurant and creative office hub[^23].

Other significant developments include One Bridgeland Green, the region's first mass timber office building designed to reduce environmental impact by 20 percent[^23], and Park Eight Place, a \$1 billion transformation of the former Halliburton campus into a 70-acre mixed-use destination[^23].

## Tax Revenue and Fiscal Performance

### Harris County Budget and Tax Revenue

Harris County Commissioners Court adopted a \$2.67 billion budget for Fiscal Year 2025, representing an 11 percent increase from the previous year[^24]. The budget includes an 8 percent property tax rate increase, enabled by disaster declarations from Governor Greg Abbott for the April flooding, May derecho, and Hurricane Beryl[^25]. This temporary increase is expected to generate an additional \$89 million in revenue and will revert to previous rates in Fiscal Year 2026[^24].

The property tax increase will raise total property taxes by \$244,831,566 (10.7 percent) compared to the previous year's budget, with \$60,564,868 representing tax revenue from new property added to the tax roll[^26]. For a homeowner with a \$400,000 house, the new tax rate increase will cost approximately \$160 additional per year[^24].

Harris County's total revenue for FY2024 reached \$7,862,043,048, equivalent to \$1,591 per capita based on the county's estimated population of 4,942,701[^27]. Revenue from property taxes totaled \$2,374,858,489 in FY2024, representing a significant portion of the county's total revenue base[^27]. The county's expenditures for FY2024 were \$7,343,800,119, or \$1,486 per capita[^27].

### State and Local Tax Performance

Texas state sales tax revenue reached \$4 billion in June 2025, representing a 2.5 percent increase from the same month in the previous year[^28]. This growth in sales tax collections indicates robust consumer spending and economic activity throughout the state, with Houston as a major contributor to these figures[^28].

Local sales and use tax collections in Houston have shown positive growth, indicating robust spending patterns despite broader economic uncertainties[^8]. This tax revenue performance supports continued public investment in infrastructure, services, and economic development initiatives throughout the region[^8].

The combination of property tax increases, sales tax growth, and new business formation has provided Harris County and Houston with enhanced fiscal capacity to address infrastructure needs, disaster recovery, and continued economic development initiatives[^24]. The county has allocated \$50 million for compensation implementation and pay equity studies for county employees, reflecting commitment to workforce development[^26].

## Economic Outlook and Future Prospects

Houston's economic trajectory for 2025 remains positive despite broader national uncertainties. The region benefits from economic diversification, international connectivity, robust population growth, and continued business investment. The Dallas Fed's Texas Employment Forecast projects 2.0 percent growth for 2025, with Houston expected to outperform state averages due to its diverse economic base[^11].

The region's advantages include no state income tax, business-friendly regulations, strategic geographic location, and world-class port facilities that support continued growth in international trade and foreign direct investment[^18]. Major infrastructure investments, including port expansion and transportation projects, position Houston to capitalize on growing global trade volumes and domestic economic expansion[^22].

Challenges include potential impacts from trade policy changes, energy market volatilities, and housing affordability pressures accompanying rapid population growth[^29]. However, Houston's economic diversification and adaptability have historically enabled the region to navigate such challenges while maintaining growth momentum[^1].

The combination of strong GDP growth, robust business formation, significant infrastructure investments, and continued corporate relocations establishes Houston as one of the nation's premier destinations for economic development and business expansion in 2025 and beyond[^2][^13][^14][^18].
