## Harris County Housing Market Challenges

The **2025 State of Housing report** from Rice University's Kinder Institute revealed significant affordability challenges despite Houston's relative affordability advantage[^29]. **Harris County added approximately 15,000 cost-burdened renters** in a single year, while affordability gaps widened to \$129,763 for the county and \$175,967 for the city of Houston[^29].

**Climate resilience** emerged as a critical factor, with over **106,975 residential structures lacking central air conditioning** and **40,205 lacking proper heating systems**[^29]. These infrastructure gaps disproportionately affected lower-income communities, adding complexity to the housing affordability crisis[^29].

## Market Outlook and Strategic Implications

Houston's real estate market positioned itself for **continued growth in the second half of 2025** and beyond. Supply constraints across multiple sectors, combined with strong population growth and economic diversification, created favorable conditions for property owners and investors[^30].

**Key growth drivers** included:

- **Population growth**: Houston ranked second nationally in population gains, adding over 43,000 residents in 2024[^30]
- **Employment expansion**: Projections indicated 47,000 to 71,000 new jobs in 2025[^30]
- **Energy sector investment**: \$1.8 billion LPG export terminal project supporting industrial demand[^11]
- **Port activity**: Record cargo volumes supporting logistics and industrial absorption[^16]

The market demonstrated **exceptional resilience** across sectors, with rental fundamentals stabilizing, commercial absorption turning positive, and investment activity rebounding strongly. While affordability challenges persisted, particularly for lower-income households, Houston maintained its competitive advantage as one of the nation's most accessible major metropolitan markets for both residential and commercial real estate investment.

Houston's **diversified economy**, strategic location, and business-friendly environment continued to attract both residents and businesses, supporting sustainable demand growth across all real estate sectors. The convergence of supply constraints, positive absorption trends, and strong economic fundamentals positioned the market for continued strength through the remainder of 2025 and into 2026.
