git commit -m "Fix Fernando-X to use popup chat instead of full page

- Changed assistant page to redirect to homepage
- Fernando-X chat starts minimized (floating button)
- Search bar 'Ask Fernando-X' opens chat popup
- Added event listener for opening chat with query
- Fixed integration between search and chat

Now Fernando-X appears as intended:
- Floating purple button with sparkles icon
- Opens as popup chat in corner
- Can be triggered from search bar
- Uses 750,000+ data points
