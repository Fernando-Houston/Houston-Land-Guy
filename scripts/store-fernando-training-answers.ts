        answer: `Start with a professional CMA analyzing 3-6 months of sold comparables within 0.5 miles and ±20% of your square footage. In this market, pricing within 2-3% of market value generates the most interest and multiple offers. Overpricing by even 5% can result in 2x longer market time and eventual price reductions. Consider pricing strategies: just below round numbers ($499k vs $500k) attracts more searches. With average list-to-sale at ${harData?.listToSaleRatio || 97}%, expect some negotiation. Online estimates like Zillow can be 10-15% off in Houston due to our diverse neighborhoods. A local realtor's expertise is invaluable for accurate pricing.`,

        answer: 'Houston building permits required: 1) Building Permit for any structural work ($75-500 base + $5-10 per $1000 of work), 2) Electrical Permit for wiring ($50-200), 3) Plumbing Permit for pipes ($50-200), 4) Mechanical Permit for HVAC ($50-200). New construction needs all permits plus site plan approval. Renovations over $5,000 typically need permits. Process takes 2-10 days for simple permits, 2-6 weeks for complex projects. Houston is actually easier than suburbs - no zoning means fewer restrictions. Must use licensed contractors for electrical/plumbing. Unpermitted work can cause issues during sale.
