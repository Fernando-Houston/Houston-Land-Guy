The best returns often come from properties in emerging neighborhoods like East Downtown (EaDo) or established areas with strong rental demand like Montrose. Cash flow usually ranges from $200-500 per door monthly after expenses. The key factors are purchase price, location, and property management efficiency. Many investors follow the 1% rule - monthly rent should be at least 1% of purchase price. With Houston's population growth and job market, rental demand remains strong.

We're seeing strong buyer demand with homes selling in around ${harData?.avgDaysOnMarket || 30} days and multiple offers common in desirable neighborhoods. The ${harData?.monthsInventory || 3.5} months of inventory indicates a seller's advantage. However, your specific situation matters - if you're buying another home, consider that you'll face the same competitive market.

      answer: `First-time buyers in Houston have great opportunities! Start by getting pre-approved to understand your budget - with current rates, many can afford more than they think. Houston offers diverse neighborhoods from affordable suburbs like Katy ($250-350k) to trendy inner-loop areas like Montrose ($400k+). Don't forget to budget for property taxes (2-3% annually) and consider flood zones - flood insurance can add $1-3k yearly in certain areas. Many first-timers love that Houston has no zoning, meaning more property flexibility. Take advantage of first-time buyer programs offering down payment assistance. The key is finding the right balance of commute, schools (if needed), and lifestyle. What's your budget range and must-haves?`,
