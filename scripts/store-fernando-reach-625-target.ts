        question: "What creative financing options work in Houston?",
        answer: `Houston's diverse market offers numerous creative financing opportunities beyond traditional mortgages:

**Seller Financing Strategies:**

**Owner Carry-Back:**
‚Ä¢ Seller acts as bank, buyer makes payments directly
‚Ä¢ Common when seller owns property free and clear
‚Ä¢ Interest rates typically 1-2% above market
‚Ä¢ Balloon payments in 3-7 years typical
‚Ä¢ Benefits: Faster closing, flexible terms, tax advantages for seller

**Wrap-Around Mortgages:**
‚Ä¢ Seller maintains existing loan, buyer pays seller
‚Ä¢ Seller pockets difference between payments
‚Ä¢ Useful when existing loan has great rate
‚Ä¢ Legal complexity requires attorney review
‚Ä¢ Risk if seller doesn't make underlying payments

**Lease-Purchase Agreements:**
‚Ä¢ Tenant pays above-market rent with purchase credits
‚Ä¢ 2-5 year lease terms with purchase option
‚Ä¢ Credits typically 25-50% of excess rent
‚Ä¢ Good for buyers with credit or down payment issues
‚Ä¢ Seller maintains depreciation benefits during lease

**Partnership Structures:**

**Equity Partnerships:**
‚Ä¢ Investor provides down payment, buyer provides income qualification
‚Ä¢ Profit splits typically 50/50 or based on investment ratio
‚Ä¢ Partnership agreement essential for exit strategies
‚Ä¢ Works well for house hacking or rental properties
‚Ä¢ Consider partnership taxes and liability issues

**Subject-To Purchases:**
‚Ä¢ Take over existing mortgage payments without assuming loan
‚Ä¢ Seller deeds property but loan stays in their name
‚Ä¢ High risk - lender can call loan due if discovered
‚Ä¢ Best in distressed situations with motivated sellers
‚Ä¢ Legal and ethical considerations important

**Hard Money and Private Lending:**

**Houston Hard Money Lenders:**
‚Ä¢ 6-12 month terms at 10-15% interest
‚Ä¢ 65-75% LTV typical

‚Ä¢ Higher rates but speed and flexibility valuable

**Private Money Sources:**
‚Ä¢ Individual investors looking for returns
‚Ä¢ Self-directed IRA investments

**FHA 203(k) Renovation Loans:**
‚Ä¢ Finance purchase plus renovations
‚Ä¢ One loan covers everything
‚Ä¢ Good for fixer-uppers
‚Ä¢ Houston's older housing stock ideal

**Houston-Specific Opportunities:**

‚Ä¢ Higher risk for buyer, higher return for seller

**Options Contracts:**

‚Ä¢ Small upfront payment for option

‚Ä¢ Good for land development timing

**Blanket Mortgages:**
