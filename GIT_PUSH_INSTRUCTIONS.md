# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

## If you get an error about existing history:

If the repository already has commits and you get an error, you might need to pull first:

```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
# Then push again
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force push (use with caution)

If you want to completely replace what's on GitHub with your local version:

```bash
git push -f origin main
```
